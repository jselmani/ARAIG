## ARAIG Exoskeleton Configuration Software

### Description
The ARAIG Exoskeleton Virtual Reality Suit is designed to provide a very realistic approach to first person video games and simulations alike.  It takes data as input from the videogame/simulation and provides output as stimulation through the suit based on how the User has interacted with the environment.

For this project, my professor gave full autonomy to the class to take the sample data he provided to us and design a configuration tool that could possibly be used for flight simulations.  This C++ program utilized the sample data provided and configured the tasks and stimulations that would be performed.

Without access to the suit, this program did not interface with the ARAIG SDK.  It is a simple mock program as to how a configuration may work on a per User basis.

### Concepts Used
This project used the following concepts of Object-Oriented Software Development:

1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Pointers & Double Pointers
4. Composition & Aggregation
5. Copy & Move Semantics
6. Reading & Writing to/from a file
